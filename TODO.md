Process: Add tests to channels.public-test.js. Test with 'runtests -lp'.

- docs: in black book, bring that and write them out
- new endpoint for moving between channels
- document channel input in all relevant endpoints
- want indicator in apiPing?
- hack migration to add 'dev' channel to current set of images on updates.jo
- channel features like disallowing (name,version) repeats
- client work?
